== TODO ==

* Target class should get tickCounter so we can set the time for each target for a check. Low-priority services can that way be checked every 10 minutes for example and high-priority targets every minute. Services class that just needs to decrease the tick counter and execute the target check if the counter reaches zero.

* ALARM_THRESHOLD should be target specific.

* Targets and Stats should be kept in the database

* Check if an internet connection is available before executing the target check.
